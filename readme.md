# Wordle Speedrun

Simple Wordle clone that was written *quickly*. The code itself is nothing elegant or fancy, but serves its purpose... 4/5 of the time. It's intended for desktop use, and a live version can be found at [l-uca.com][live_link]. Words are raandomly generated from a partial Wordle list, and the answer can be found in the console.
